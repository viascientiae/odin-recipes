    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Cut 1 cup of unsalted butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Gradually add 6-8 tablespoons of cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough in half, shape each half into a disc, wrap them in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
        <li>Peel, core, and slice 6-7 apples into thin, even slices.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the apple slices with 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. Toss until the apples are coated.</li>
        <li>Roll out one of the chilled pie crusts on a floured surface to fit your pie dish.</li>
        <li>Place the rolled-out crust into the pie dish, pressing it gently against the sides.</li>
        <li>Pour the prepared apple filling into the pie crust, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Roll out the second chilled pie crust and place it over the apple filling.</li>
        <li>Trim any excess crust hanging over the edges and crimp the edges to seal the pie.</li>
        <li>If desired, beat one egg and brush it over the top crust. Sprinkle with a little additional granulated sugar for a golden finish.</li>
        <li>Cut a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 45-55 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least an hour before serving.</li>
        <li>Slice and enjoy your homemade Apple Pie, optionally serving it with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream for an extra treat.</li>
        <li>Relish in the sweet, comforting aroma of freshly baked Apple Pie as you indulge in its perfect balance of sweet, tender apples and a flaky, golden crust. Whether it's a special occasion or a simple dessert to brighten any day, this classic pie embodies the joy of homemade goodness.</li>
