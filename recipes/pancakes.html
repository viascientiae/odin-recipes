        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by gathering all the ingredients for your Pancakes.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat 2 large eggs and add 1 cup of milk, along with 2 tablespoons of melted unsalted butter. Optionally, add a teaspoon of vanilla extract for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay. The batter should be thick but pourable.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat and lightly grease it with cooking oil or additional melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup of pancake batter onto the hot griddle for each pancake. Use the back of a spoon to spread the batter into a circular shape if needed.</li>
        <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges appear slightly set, usually about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip the pancake using a spatula and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until both sides are golden brown and the pancakes are cooked through.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate, and continue cooking the remaining batter in batches.</li>
        <li>Serve your pancakes warm, with your choice of toppings. Popular options include butter, maple syrup, fresh berries, or a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
        <li>11. Savor the delightful aroma of freshly cooked pancakes, and indulge in their fluffy goodness. Whether you prefer them simple or adorned with your favorite toppings, pancakes are a timeless breakfast treat that brings warmth and comfort to your day. Enjoy your pancake adventure!</li>
