    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French Toast is a classic breakfast dish cherished for its simplicity and deliciousness. Made from slices of bread soaked in a mixture of beaten eggs, milk, and a touch of vanilla extract, French Toast transforms stale bread into a warm, golden delight. As it sizzles on a hot griddle, it crisps up on the outside while remaining irresistibly soft and custard-like on the inside. The magic happens when it's generously dusted with powdered sugar, drizzled with maple syrup, or adorned with fresh berries and a dollop of whipped cream. Whether served as a cozy weekend brunch treat or a quick morning indulgence, French Toast is a timeless comfort food that never goes out of style.</p>

        <li>Begin by gathering all the ingredients for your French Toast.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, crack open the eggs and beat them until the yolks and whites are well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour in the milk, add a dash of vanilla extract, and a pinch of sugar. For an extra burst of flavor, you can sprinkle in some ground cinnamon (if desired) and a pinch of salt.</li>

        <li>Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and add a small amount of butter or cooking oil. Allow it to melt and coat the cooking surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Take a slice of bread and dip it into the egg mixture, making sure both sides are well soaked but not soggy.</li>
