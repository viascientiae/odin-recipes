# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview

**Odin Recipes** is the first project from the Foundations course of **The Odin Project**, located at the end of the HTML Foundations unit. The primary objective of this project is to apply the HTML knowledge acquired throughout the unit by creating a basic recipes website.

The website will feature a main index page that includes hyperlinks to several pages containing different recipes.

The website may not look very attractive as the project is only meant to practice HTML skill. The project will be revisited in the future during this course or subsequent courses to style it up using CSS.

## Key Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following HTML skills:

- Creating an HTML boilerplate.
- Adding necessary meta tags within the `<head>` element of the HTML root, including the character set.
- Including a `<title>` element within the `<head>` for page titles.
- Inserting various text elements within the `<body>`, such as headings and paragraph texts.
- Utilizing semantic tags, such as `<strong>` for indicating strong importance or emphasis.
- Applying `<em>` tags for emphasizing text within the content, which is typically rendered in italics but can vary based on styling.
- Creating lists using the appropriate HTML tags.
- Incorporating links to other pages and inserting images as needed using anchor and image tags.
